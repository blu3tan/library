# Library

Live demo: https://blu3tan.github.io/library/

This is my take on the Library project (without storage)

As always my goal is to deliver (given my current capabilities) something close
to a real web app, with in mind aesthetics and user experience.

The project is mobile responsive even tho the modal backdrop
animation is not working on firefox right now.
There are 4 books hard coded just to showcase an hypothetical real behavior, 
this led to a little much more javascript but the result is way more appealing
in my opinion so totally worth it.
On the same note, every new book added gets a random color inside a range (thanks hsl).

I have added a second modal mostly for the credits, but took the opportunity
to display also a little guide. Not sure is needed, the app uses 3 buttons, 
but since i like clean and intuitive design i try to avoid text labels on buttons, 
here was possible.

Any feedback would be highly appreciated, enjoy.
